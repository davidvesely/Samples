        DotNetZip File Service Sample Upload Data Form</h1>
    <p>
        This sample WCF service reads the contents of an HTML file upload and writes one
        or more body parts to a local file while decompressing the contents on the fly using
        a deflate stream from the DotNetZip library.
    </p>
    <form action="http://localhost:8082/dotnetzipservice" enctype="multipart/form-data"
    method="POST">
    What is your name?
    <input name="submitter" size="40" type="text"><br>
    What file are you uploading?
    <input name="data" size="40" type="file">
