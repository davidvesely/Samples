                This sample WCF service reads the contents of an HTML file upload and deserializes
                the contents into a local object which is then returned in the response.

            <p>
                This sample WCF service reads the contents of a traditional HTML file upload and
                writes one or more body parts to a local file.</p>

        <dd>
            <p>
                This sample WCF service reads the contents of an HTML5 file upload supporting multiple
                files to be included in the same form submission and writes one or more body parts
                to a local file.</p>

        <dd>
            <p>
                This sample WCF service reads the contents of an HTML file upload and writes one
                or more body parts to a local file while decompressing the contents on the fly using
                a deflate stream from the DotNetZip library.</p>

            <p>
                This sample WCF service reads the contents of multiple individual HTML file upload
                requests and returns a list of all of then when done. This illustrates how to do
                upload of spanned archives.</p>
